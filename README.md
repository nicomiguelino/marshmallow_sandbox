# Experimenting with marshmallow


## About marshmallow

According to [marshmallow's official website](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), "[it] is an ORM/ODM/framework-agnostic library for converting complex datatypes, such as objects, to and from native Python datatypes."

We don't have to write an object to JSON mapper (and the other way around) from scratch. We could harness the power of marshmallow instead.
